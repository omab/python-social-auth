Python Social Auth
==================

Python Social Auth is an easy-to-setup social authentication/registration
mechanism with support for several frameworks and auth providers.

Crafted using base code from django-social-auth, it implements a common interface
to define new authentication providers from third parties, and to bring support
for more frameworks and ORMs.

Deprecation notice - 03-12-2016
-------------------------------

As for Dec 03 2016, this library is now deprecated, the codebase was
split and migrated into the `python-social-auth organization`_,
where a more organized development process is expected to take place.

Details about moving towards the new setup is documented in the
`migrating to social`_ document.
