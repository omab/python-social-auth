Microsoft Azure Active Directory
======

To enable OAuth2 support:

- Fill in ``Client ID`` and ``Client Secret`` settings. These values can be obtained
  easily as described in `Azure AD Application Registration`_ doc::

      SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_OAUTH2_KEY = ''
      SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_OAUTH2_SECRET = ''

- Also it's possible to define extra permissions with::

      SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_OAUTH2_RESOURCE = ''

      This is the resource you would like to access after authentication succeeds. 
      Some of the possible values are: ``https://graph.windows.net`` or ``https://<your Sharepoint site name>-my.sharepoint.com``.
